# Katherine Dunham

Katherine Dunham was a dancer and choreographer. This data contains information about her works from _1937 - 1962_.

With this project, I aim to gain insights on:

- Performances
- Impact
- Cultural influence

Generally, I want to look at her _contribution to art and the cultural landscape_
